    title: "Night Shifts & Late-Night Code: Becoming a Full-Stack Dev After Work",
    description:
      "Working full-time in a shop and coding 2–3 hours after 10PM — how I balanced shifts, sleepiness, and a burning passion to become a full-stack developer without formal certificates.",

      "I work a full day — bakery or textiles, depending on the week — and most evenings I’m wiped out. Still, after 10PM, I open my laptop and code for two or three hours. It’s not a glamorous routine: tired eyes, a small desk light, coffee or chai late at night. But that routine kept me moving. My interest wasn’t casual; it was a deep, burning pull to become a full-stack developer.",
      "I don’t have certificates from fancy bootcamps. I couldn’t attend courses because of my situation. That’s why I enrolled in IGNOU for a BCA in 2025 — to get a proper degree while I continue learning the stack on my own. Balancing work, studies, and late-night coding is hard, but every small win (a working API, a polished component, a deployed demo) felt like proof that the grind was worth it.",
      "Those late hours taught me two things: consistency beats intensity, and direction beats randomness. I learned to plan small goals for each night — one bug, one UI tweak, one new concept — and slowly my projects began looking and feeling like real work. I focused on building things people can use, not just exercises on a tutorial.",
      "I still hope for a team where I can contribute and grow. I’m building the skills now so that when the chance comes, I can give everything to a product and a group that believes in practical, user-first code."

    title: "Diploma Dropped, Determination Kept: Choosing Self-Learning",
    description:
      "I started a polytechnic diploma in computer engineering but had to quit. That setback pushed me toward self-learning — 2–3 hours daily after work — and a new map to become a software engineer.",

      "After finishing my plus-two in 2023, I enrolled in a polytechnic diploma in computer engineering. I was excited — the idea of becoming a software engineer felt alive in me. But life made a different plan: after the first semester I had to quit because of circumstances I couldn’t control. It felt like a door closing.",
      "Instead of letting that end my story, I decided to find another way. I saw many people in the industry who learned on their own, built solid projects, and earned jobs without following the traditional route. That gave me hope. I committed to learning by myself: two to three hours every day after my full-time shifts, practicing fundamentals, making tiny projects, and learning to ship.",
      "The discipline mattered more than talent. While others attended classes, I turned late nights into lessons: reading docs, watching tutorials, copying then improving examples, and slowly building a portfolio. My focus became user-centric projects — things that solve small problems and teach real-world engineering.",
      "Quitting the diploma didn’t stop me — it made me more determined. If you’re in the same place, don’t think of the dropout as failure. Treat it as a detour that taught you to steer your own path."

      "I learned HTML, CSS and JavaScript on my phone using Replit for months. When I finally got an old laptop, everything changed — small projects became real and the momentum started.",

      "At first I didn’t even have a laptop. I learned the basics — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — on my mobile phone using Replit. It wasn’t ideal: typing on a small screen, limited file structure, and no local server for more advanced experiments. Still, for three months (June, July, August), I built small exercises and learned how things fit together. I learned to be patient and creative with limited tools.",
      "Those months taught me the value of persistence. Replit gave me just enough to understand how to structure pages and make things interactive, but I desperately wanted to build full projects. The turning point came in September when I finally got an old laptop. It wasn’t new, but it was a doorway.",
      "With a laptop I could run local dev environments, push to GitHub, and deploy. I started small — clones of tutorials, then tiny original projects, then a portfolio. Seeing a project live on the web for the first time hit me hard: the feeling of creating something real is addicting in the best way.",
      "Now I’m excited again and always learning. From a phone screen to a full setup, the journey has been slow but honest. If you’re starting with limited tools, know this: you can still make real progress. Small, steady work adds up — and a single working project can open many doors."

      "When I started this project, I wanted to push myself beyond simple CRUD apps. The idea of building an e-commerce platform felt intimidating, but also exciting — it had all the challenges I needed: authentication, payments, data modeling, and UI state management.",
      "I used MongoDB for a flexible product schema, Express.js for API routes, React for the front-end, and Node.js to glue everything together. Tailwind CSS helped me move fast with design, keeping the UI consistent without writing too much custom CSS.",
      "One of the hardest parts was implementing PayPal checkout and order tracking. I had to carefully manage API calls, user sessions, and edge cases like failed payments. Debugging those flows taught me the importance of clean error handling and user feedback.",
      "By the end, I had a working app with filters, sorting, carts, checkout, and even an admin dashboard. More importantly, I left with a stronger understanding of how full-stack apps are structured in the real world."

    content: [
      "After building projects with MERN, I realized my old portfolio felt slow and outdated. I wanted something modern, performant, and more fun to browse — so I chose Next.js for server-side rendering and routing, plus Framer Motion for subtle animations.",
      "Animations made a huge difference. I added fade-ins, slide-ups, and staggered transitions that gave the site a polished, professional feel without being too distracting.",
      "The other big upgrade was moving images and videos to Cloudinary. Before, I manually compressed files, but Cloudinary’s CDN and on-the-fly transformations handled everything automatically. My load times dropped drastically, especially on mobile.",
      "This project was less about learning fundamentals and more about refinement: performance, polish, and user experience. It taught me how important small details are in leaving a good impression."

      "AI apps fascinated me because they combined full-stack challenges with the unknowns of working with large language models. My first project, NewWay, generated custom study roadmaps for students. It forced me to think hard about prompt design and how to guide AI responses reliably.",
      "Then I built Shortly, a PDF summarizer powered by OpenAI/Gemini. Handling file uploads, parsing text, and streaming back results was tricky — especially keeping the UI responsive while the AI processed large documents.",
      "I also learned how important UI feedback is for async tasks. Spinners, progress indicators, and clear messaging turned confusing waiting periods into smooth experiences for users.",
      "These projects taught me that building with AI isn’t just about calling an API. It’s about managing uncertainty, guiding the model with structure, and making sure the end experience feels seamless."
